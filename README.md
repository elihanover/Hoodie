Hoodie is an experimental __collaborative real estate canvas__, where agents and buyers can work together to facilitate a fundamentally better homebuying experience.

## Motivation
For Agents:
- Empower agents to give clients a luxury experience outside of a platform
- Save agents time showing homes by narrowing down properties
- Solve the problem of buyer disloyalty for agents by creating a buyer's "home base" that incentivizes them to stay with their buyer

For Buyers:
- Autogenerate routes to your favorite spots when you add a new home to you canvas (bye bye Google maps)
- View all of these routes simultaneously as a "web"
- Sort properties based on their proximity to your locations or their median proximity across _all_ your locations
- Filter properties by tags
- Separate chats with your agent for each home
- Share your search with friends and family, allowing them to comment and give feedback
